Here are some instructions to test out:

1. Deploying a GKE cluster (gke directory)
2. Deploying Istio Ambient Mesh (install-ambient.md)
3. Deploying a sample app (sampleapp.md)
4. Deploying Ingress using Gloo Gateway for Ambient Mesh (options for L7 and no L7 Waypoints)
5. Using the Gloo Mesh UI
6. A routing demo with `VirtualService` and `DestinationRule` (routing directory) for circuit breaking and balancing load.
